TCP File Transfer Lab:

For this lab, we were supposed to create a Client and a Server to send files.

Running:

To the run the lab, you must do "./fileServer.py" in order to open the server. Then you must go to the folder client is in and open the client by doing "./fileClient.py". From there it would ask you what text file you would like to input. you input the text file name, and then it would tell you if it was sent/recieved, and you would see that file in the same location as the server.
